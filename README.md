Task manager app.\
This is a project for a coderslab bootcamp. It's a simple console task manager app with commands to add a task, remove a task, list all tasks, or exit the programme.

On start, the programme loads a file with saved tasks and stores the tasks data in an array. It prompts the user to select one of the 4 menu options: add, remove, list, exit.

Add prompts the user for 3 inputs, indicating the input format: task description, due date and whetether the task is important.
The task is saved in the tasks array.

Remove prompts the user to select which task should be removed and removes the chosen task from the tasks array.

List lists all the tasks in the array in a properly formatted manner.

Exit saves the tasks array to a file by overwriting it and exits the program.
